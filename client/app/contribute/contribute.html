      <p>Our App allows you to select projects that you want to contribute to.</p>
      <p>We have a variety of scientific and mathematical projects to select from. No need to worry about our app slowing down your computer; it only runs when your computer is idle, and is fully customizable.</p>
      <p>Specify times to run, whether to cut off at low battery levels, and so forth. Additionally, for our security conscious users, the application runs on a Virtual Machine, protecting you from any potential sources of maliciou code that unknowing scientists may be using!</p>

      <p>We integrate your algorithm into our system, upload and promote it through our application, and drive users towards your project so that you obtain valuable computing power.</p>
      <p>What types of projects fit:</p>
      <p>At this point we are pretty flexible. Generally speaking, scientific or mathematical projects are the best fit, but if you believe users would be interested in contributing to your project and our platform may be of assistance to you, please contact us.</p>
